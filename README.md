# Project Description:

The project is a small implementation of a widely used transaction-based processing system - the Airline Reservation System. It incorporates various functionalities like airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger reservations, and ticket records, etc. We process different types of requests/transactions by implementing various database operations like insertions, selections, group by, join, order by, aggregate functions (eg: count), etc.
